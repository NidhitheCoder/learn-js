# what is an algorithm ?
An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.
- An algorithm have well defined outputs and inputs.
- Each step sould be clear and unabiguous.
- An algorithm is language indipendent.
- Learning algorithm translates to learning different techniques to efficiently solve those problems.
- On problem  can be solved in many ways using  different algorithms.
